Microhouse Web Services Stack API (for gen2/RMS) is published here to help our customers use our "basic" API for our RMS stack. This is the gen2 iteration, and we have already sarted gen3.

Please start with our [Wiki](https://github.com/babakm/mhswsstackapi-gen2rms/wiki) to learn about how to use this basic API.
